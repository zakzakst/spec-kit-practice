# 12 Principles of Animation

Disney animators codified these principles in the 1930s to make drawings feel real. We use them to make pixels feel human. The problems are surprisingly similar.

## When to Apply

Reference these guidelines when:

- Adding motion to UI components
- Reviewing animation quality and feel
- Designing micro-interactions and feedback
- Making interfaces feel more alive and responsive
- Deciding what should (and shouldn't) animate

## Principles Overview

| #   | Principle                     | Web Application                                           |
| --- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Squash and Stretch            | Convey weight and elasticity in morphing elements         |
| 2   | Anticipation                  | Prepare users for what comes next (wind-up before action) |
| 3   | Staging                       | Direct attention through sequential animation             |
| 4   | Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose | Define keyframes, let browser interpolate                 |
| 5   | Follow Through & Overlapping  | Use springs for organic overshoot-and-settle              |
| 6   | Slow In & Slow Out            | Apply easing curves for natural acceleration              |
| 7   | Arcs                          | Add curved paths for organic movement                     |
| 8   | Secondary Action              | Reinforce primary actions with subtle flourishes          |
| 9   | Timing                        | Keep interactions under 300ms, be consistent              |
| 10  | Exaggeration                  | Amplify motion for emphasis (sparingly)                   |
| 11  | Solid Drawing                 | Use perspective, shadows, and depth                       |
| 12  | Appeal                        | The sum of all techniques applied with care               |

## Quick Reference

### 1. Squash and Stretch

Digital objects don't have physics, so we fake it. Subtle deformation conveys weight—but don't overdo it or professional software becomes a cartoon.

### 2. Anticipation

Give cues before major actions. Pull-to-refresh hints, buttons that compress before sending. Reserve for moments that matter—too many wind-ups make apps feel sluggish.

### 3. Staging

Guide the eye through sequential animation. Dim backgrounds, focus on important elements. Direct attention like a film.

### 4. Straight Ahead & Pose to Pose

Focus on key poses: start state, end state, maybe a midpoint. Context menus animate on exit only—entrance animation compounds into irritation.

### 5. Follow Through & Overlapping

Nothing moves as a single rigid unit. Springs add organic overshoot-and-settle that easing curves can't replicate. But too much stagger makes interfaces feel slow.

### 6. Slow In & Slow Out

- `ease-out`: Entrances (arrive fast, settle gently)
- `ease-in`: Exits (build momentum before departure)
- `ease-in-out`: Deliberate movements

### 7. Arcs

Curved paths feel inevitable, like water finding its level. Best for hero moments and playful interactions. Utilitarian interfaces work fine with straight lines.

### 8. Secondary Action

Flourishes supporting the main action—sparkles after success, sound effects on impact. Think games: they combine sound and visual effects for impact.

### 9. Timing

Keep interactions under 300ms. Be consistent—if one button animates at 200ms, all buttons should. Define timing scales early, reuse everywhere.

### 10. Exaggeration

Push past physical accuracy to make points land harder. Use sparingly for onboarding, empty states, confirmations, or errors.

### 11. Solid Drawing

Shadows suggest depth. Layering implies hierarchy. CSS `perspective` gives 3D transforms actual depth.

### 12. Appeal

The difference between software you tolerate and software you love. Not one technique—the sum of all techniques applied with care and taste.

## Key Guidelines

- **Balance**: Too much animation turns professional software into a cartoon
- **Consistency**: Define timing scales early, reuse everywhere
- **Purpose**: Great animation is invisible—users think "this feels good"
- **Restraint**: Not everything needs to be animated
